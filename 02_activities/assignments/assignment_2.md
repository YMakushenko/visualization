## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
    '''Good data visualization: https://www.visualcapitalist.com/history-of-pandemics-deadliest/
    
    I classified it as good because:

    â€¢  Itâ€™s clear and easy to read. It uses a bubble chart where the size of each bubble represents the number of deaths caused by each pandemic. This makes it easy to compare the relative impact of different pandemics.

    â€¢  The colors are effectively used to distinguish between different pandemics and historical periods. It helps quickly identify and differentiate pandemics. 

    â€¢  Itâ€™s informative and contextual. Each bubble contains the name of the pandemic and the number of deaths. There is a timeline at the bottom that provides historical context, making it easier for the viewer to understand the temporal distribution of pandemics.

    â€¢  Itâ€™s attractive and interactive, allowing users to hover over each bubble to get more detailed information.

    In my opinion, an important goal has been achieved here - to show users the importance of the problem, to make them think about the importance of their health and the health of others.

    I classified it as bad because:

    â€¢  Itâ€™s very complex, with too many elements and data points plotted on a single image. This complexity makes it difficult to understand the main message.

    â€¢  Ð¡olor scheme used in the visualization is ineffective. There are too many colors, many of which are similar, making it hard to distinguish between different data points. 

    â€¢  Labels and legends are either missing or not clear enough to provide context to the data, making it difficult for users to understand what each item means.

    â€¢  The way the data is presented can be misleading. For example, in this data visualization https://datavizproject.com/data-type/bubble-map-chart/ they used the dimension of the baloon as a number of people that live in a district, and the color of the baloon as a persentage of foreighners. It's too complicated to inderstand. Users may get confused by seeing a small, but dark and with a large percentage, balloon.'''

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```This data visualization could have been inmproved by:

    â€¢  Simplifying the design. Unnecessary elements should be remove and focus should be on the key data points.

    â€¢  Using a limited and distinct color palette to clearly distinguish the data points. The colors should be used consistently and meaningfully to aid understanding.

    â€¢  Clearing labels and legends.```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
