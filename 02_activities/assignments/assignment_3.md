# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
        I think the "good" visualization (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/history-of-pandemics-deadliest/) is:
        - Accessible because it uses a clear and distinct color scheme that makes it easy to distinguish between different pandemics and their time frames; the text is legible and has an appropriate size, which ensures that viewers can read the information without straining; offers an interactive interface that allows users to hover over elements for additional information, increasing user interaction and understanding.
        - Reproducible. The visualization likely relies on reliable historical data, but the raw data isn't immediately visible or referenced, which can hinder reproducibility; while the visualization effectively conveys information, it doesn't provide detailed methodology or data sources, making it difficult for others to replicate the exact visualization.
        - Equitable. The visualization covers pandemics from different regions and time periods, providing a global perspective; there is no apparent bias in the presentation, each pandemic is treated equally, ensuring a balanced view.

        
        The "bad" visualization (https://www.flickr.com/photos/densitydesign/albums/72157631774207511/) is:
        - Accessible. The color scheme is too complex and lacks contrast, making it difficult to distinguish between different data points; the text is small and messy, which makes it difficult to read and understand the information presented.
        - Reproducible. There are no visible links to the data sources, making it impossible to verify or reproduce the visualizations; the lack of explanation of the methods used to create the visualizations further hinders reproducibility.
        - Equitable. Visualizations may reflect biases in the selection or presentation of data that aren't transparent to the viewer; focusing on specific data sets without context or explanation can lead to misinterpretation and doesn't ensure a fair representation of all relevant data.

        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        The "good" data visualization could have been improved in the following areas:
        - Accessibility. Adding descriptive alt text to images can improve accessibility for visually impaired users.
        - Reproducibility. Including references to data sources and a detailed description of the methodology used will greatly improve reproducibility; providing the raw data in a downloadable format will allow others to test and create visualizations.
        - Equity. Adding more context about the impact of each pandemic on different socio-economic groups can provide a fairer view; ensuring that rendering is available on all devices, including devices with lower bandwidth, can improve equitability.


        The "bad" data visualization could have been improved in the following areas:
        - Accessibility. Using a color palette with better contrast can make the visualization more accessible to those with color vision deficiencies; increasing the font size and making the text clearer can improve legibility.
        - Reproducibility. Providing clear references to data sources and a detailed explanation of methodology will increase reproducibility; providing the underlying data for download will allow others to reproduce and test the visualizations.
        - Equity. Adding context about the data sources and implications of visualizations can help viewers understand the broader impact and ensure a fairer representation.

        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

### Rubric:
